# Fruit and Colour Predictor
This is my implementation of a 4 service application. This application consists of a front-end Web App that is 
interacted with by the user. This service invokes a second service that produces the content to be shown on 
the front-end Web App. This service invokes two other services that each produce half of the information
needed by the second service to produce the final content.
